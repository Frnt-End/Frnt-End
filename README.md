### Hello & Welcome ðŸ‘‹

**Nice to e-meet you!**

My name is Nirit & I enjoy creating accessible, human-centered products

**A little bit more..**

I have gained hands-on experience in various skills as Frontend Engineer and as a Web Designer.I'm a curious creature and a relentless problem solver. more than 90% of what I know, I have learned by myself, it is very easy for me to pick up new skills and adapt to changes and new processes.In my work, my biggest achievements is when Iâ€™m able to witness a product, that I have been part of his creation, reaching, both, the business goals and the users needs.

**It's all about the passion**

***I love what I do and I keep learning every dayðŸ˜Š***
